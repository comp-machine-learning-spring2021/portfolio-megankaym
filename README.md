# CSC294 Computational Machine Learning Final Portfolio

----About----
Hi! I'm Megan McKenzie, a senior at Smith College majoring in computer science and minoring in chemistry with a research background in AI. I'm interested in using technology and programming as a tool to solve real world problems like creating software for the field of engineering or improving health outcomes.

This semester, I'm taking Professor Kinnaird's CSC294-01: Computational Machine Learning course. We've practiced using supervised and unsupervised learning for classification and clustering. We covered different machine learning models like kNN, linear regression, decision trees, SVM, k-means, random forest, and more. We also explored using PCA to reduce dimensionality of data, as well as deep learning and bench marking. 

My interests beyond this machine learning course will begin as I enter the tech industry upon graduation this coming May. I'm hoping that I get to apply my machine learning knowledge some way in the future, whether that be part of some data science work or for fun on my own time and curiosity. This knowledge  is so handy, as data is ubiquitous.


This portfolio describes some of the work I have accomplished in this course in an organized and intentional way that highlights some of my favorite machine learning endeavors.
