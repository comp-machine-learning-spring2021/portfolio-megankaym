# MNIST Covolutional Neural Network


The application of machine learning tools is vital for solving real world problems. This component of the portfolio explores the intersection between computer vision and machine learning. 


# ----Background----
The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, otherwise known as MNIST, database contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.

A neural network is a class of supervised (all data is labelled*) machine learning algorithms that can find complex patterns and relationships in data to solve complex problems (both classification and regression problems) and enable deep learning.

* A label is the thing a model is trying to predict. For this project, our label is what number is written in an image.

A Convolutional Neural Network, otherwise known as a “Convnet”, is built using neurons** and fully connected layers just like traditional neural networks, but they also have convolutional layers. Convolutional layers contain a set of filters/kernels, parameters of which are to be learned throughout the training. The size of the filters is usually smaller than the actual image. Each filters are applied to the images.

**Neurons are interconnected nodes in a layered structure that resembles the human brain.
